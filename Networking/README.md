## Overview of folder

A culmination of everything I'm doing that's Networking related.

### CCNA 

CCNA Mindmap - a mind-map I made that's based on the blueprint of the CCNA 200-301. Should be used as an overview. Choose one resource that comprehensively dives into each topic on the blueprint, and return back to the mind-map to help you get that overview of it all.

CCNA PT Lab - a PT lab that's based on many of the concepts covered within the CCNA. Feel free to comment on it if there's any issues. There's a list of configuration tasks that I'll knock off one by one, slowly. There's also some notes relating to thoughts I had, as well as other technologies that would (most likely) be seen in an enterprise network of today (May 2021).

### CCNP

CCNP ENCOR 350-401.drawio - a collection of diagrams related to studying for the CCNP ENCOR 350-401. Updated as it is finished.

CCNP ENCOR.xmind - an XMind document serving as a summary of the content inside the CCNP. Updated as it is finished.

### Meraki

Meraki Exhibit1-6/Rough1 - a series of (poorly drawn? I used a stylus to draw the diagrams - hence the general hacky nature of them) slides that I created as an overview of the Meraki Cloud architecture and some basic operations. To be used as an overview. Also, see documentation.meraki.com for more information.
