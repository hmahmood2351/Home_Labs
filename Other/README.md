SDN - Excerpt of a newspaper from the late 80s, covering what a technology that was then called, SDN. Some interesting statements such as a 

*'Dedicated SDN control center with specific technicians who can help you monitor and provision your SDN. Our service is so efficient, you'll think your company has its own private network. Yet you'll only be charged for the actual time and distance of your calls.'*

That sounds oddly like a technology we have today...


Arpanet_map_1973 - a logical topology of the ARPANET network as it was in 1973. Interesting to see the development from an originally four-node network to the Internet today.
