**SDN** - Excerpt of a newspaper from the late 80s, covering what a technology that was then called, SDN. Some interesting statements such as a 

>'Dedicated SDN control center with specific technicians who can help you monitor and provision your SDN. Our service is so efficient, you'll think your company has its own private network. Yet you'll only be charged for the actual time and distance of your calls.'

That sounds oddly like a technology we have today...

**Arpanet_map_1973** - a logical topology of the ARPANET network as it was in 1973. Interesting to see the development from an originally four-node network to the Internet today.


**Baran_nets_large** - a diagram made by Paul Baran, outlining ideas related to distributed communication systems. See here: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3420.html

An interesting quote:

>'The requirements for a future all-digital-data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including "real-time" voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central—and therefore vulnerable—control point.'

That sounds oddly like a technology we have today... I wonder why.
